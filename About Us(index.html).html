            <h2>Our Story</h2> <p>At Grab a Bite, we believe in creating delicious moments that bring people together. Our journey began in 2020, born out of a passion for great food and the desire to share it with others. It all started as a small idea between friends who loved to cook and wanted to bring something special to the local food scene. We aimed to create a space where people could come, relax, and enjoy quality food with a personal touch. Our mission was to serve not just food, but an experience.</p>

            <p>As the word spread, Grab a Bite quickly became a local favorite. The combination of freshly brewed coffee, freshly made pastries, and unique meal options attracted customers from all walks of life. Over time, we expanded our menu to include a wide range of dishes, all prepared with locally sourced ingredients. Today, weâ€™re proud to be a community hub where people meet, work, laugh, and share a bite together.</p><p>At Grab a Bite, we believe in creating delicious moments that bring people together.
